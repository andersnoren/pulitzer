# Pulitzer

Pulitzer is a minimal blog theme designed for writers, with special consideration for newsletters. It features a reading time indicator, four different archive layouts to choose from, complete page patterns for your resume, newsletter, contact page, and archive, like and share buttons on single posts, and a newsletter subscribe form in the footer. The like/share buttons and subscribe form require the Jetpack plugin to be active and the Subscription feature to be enabled. Demo: https://pulitzer.andersnoren.se

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
